# Energy Prediction

## 📘 Project Description
This project aims to analyze and predict household energy consumption using machine learning.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used is **Household Power Consumption**, which contains measurements of electric power consumption in one household.

- File: `household_power_consumption.zip`
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository

## 🧹 Data Cleaning
- Replaced missing values with NaN.
- Removed invalid rows.
- Converted numeric columns to float.

## ⚙️ Files Included
- `energy_prediction.ipynb`: Notebook with preprocessing and analysis.
- `household_power_consumption.zip`: Raw dataset.

## 🚀 Objective
To preprocess the dataset and prepare it for further modeling and prediction.
